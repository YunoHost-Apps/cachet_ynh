## Configuration

Totally configurable through the Cachet application dashboard.

## Limitations

- Must necessarily be installed on domain root (see upstream issue [here](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet/issues/1696))
- Can't integrate with YunoHost SSO as LDAP support is not implemented yet (see upstream issue [here](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet/issues/2108))
