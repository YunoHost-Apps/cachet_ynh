## Overview

[Cachet](https://cachethq.io/) is a free, open source status page for your API, service or company. Built with all of the features that you'd expect from a status page, Cachet comes with a powerful API, a metric system, multiple user support, two factor authentication for added security and is easy to get setup. A powerful, self-hosted alternative to StatusPage.io and Status.io.


**Shipped version:** 2.4.0~ynh4

**Demo:** https://demo.cachethq.io
